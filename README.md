Let me explain the Cl√≠nica Patitas web design from a programmer's perspective:

1. Basic Structure:
- Header with simple nav bar (3 links: Home, Services, Contact)
- Hero section with background image (dog) and dark overlay for better readability
- 3-column grid for main services

2. Main Components:
- Minimalist navigation bar
- Hero section with overlaid title
- Service cards (3 identical components with different content)

3. Design System:
- Color palette: white, purple/blue for accents
- Iconography: simple lines, outline style
- Typography: sans-serif, likely variable weight system for titles/subtitles

4. Key Features:
- Responsive design
- CSS Grid/Flexbox-based layout
- SVG icons for better scalability
- Gradient overlay on hero image for better text contrast

5. UI Elements:
- Cards with hover states (presumably)
- Interactive icons
- Responsive text
- Potentially collapsible menu for mobile

The design follows modern UI/UX principles with a clear, hierarchical structure, optimized for conversion and ease of use.

Additional Development Notes:
- Likely built with a modern frontend framework
- Clean component architecture
- Mobile-first approach
- Semantic HTML structure
- Optimized image loading for performance
- Accessible design patterns
